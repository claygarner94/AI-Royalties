# AI-Royalties
An IP framework to compensate artists and IP-holders for AI-generated content

### Abstract
This article investigates how AI-generated content can disrupt central revenue streams of the creative industries, in particular the collection of dividends from intellectual property (IP) rights. It reviews the IP and copyright questions related to the input and output of generative AI systems. A systematic method is proposed to assess whether AI-generated outputs, especially images, violate previous copyrights, using a CLIP metric between images against historical
copyright rulings. An examination (economic and technical feasibility) of previously proposed compensation frameworks reveals their financial implications for creatives and IP holders. Lastly, we propose a novel IP framework for compensation of artists and IP holders based on their published ``licensed AIs'' as a new medium and asset from which to collect AI royalties.
